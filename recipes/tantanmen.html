            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Tan Tan Ramen (Tantanmen) is a rich and flavorful Japanese ramen noodle soup adapted from the famous Chinese Sichuan dan dan mian. It's unique for both its savory topping and the spicy yet creamy soup broth. This hot bowl of ramen is too good to be missed!</p>
            <h2>What is Tan Tan Ramen?</h2>
            <p>Tan tan ramen—as it is called in the US—is known as tantanmen (坦々麺) in Japan. Unlike classic ramen varieties (mainly shio ramen, miso ramen, and shoyu ramen), tantanmen doesn’t have the usual toppings such as chashu and ramen egg (ajitsuke tamago or ajitama).</p>
            <p>The ingredients and seasonings vary depending on the ramen shop. However, the most distinctive feature of tantanmen is the spicy soup made with chili oil and spicy bean paste called doubanjiang. The unique color of the soup broth comes mainly from the sesame paste and soy milk. The flavor of the broth is mellow so that the spiciness can come through. Tan tan ramen is always topped with stir-fried niku miso or sweet and savory ground pork, along with some green vegetables.</p>
            <p>There is a layer of complexity to the soup and you get to enjoy the contrast between sweet and spicy ingredients.</p>

                <h4>For the Soup Seasonings ("Tare")</h4>
                <li>2 Tbsp Japanese sesame paste (neri goma) (substitute it with Chinese sesame paste or tahini, or make my Neri Goma recipe)</li>
                <li>1 tsp miso (I use my favorite miso by Hikari Miso; most types will work, with the exception of Saikyo and Hatcho varieties; try different miso types to create a slightly different flavor for the soup broth)</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 tsp rice vinegar (unseasoned)</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp la-yu (Japanese chili oil) (store bought or make my quick and easy Homemade La-yu)</li>
                <h4>For the Pork Mixture</h4>

                <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, rice bran, canola, etc.)</li>
                <li>170 g ground pork (for vegan/vegetarian, you can use meat alternatives or chopped mushrooms)</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp sake (substitute it with Chinese rice wine or dry sherry)</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp doubanjiang (spicy chili bean sauce/broad bean paste) (you can use either the spicy or non-spicy type, or use gluten-free doubanjiang)</li>
                <li>2 tsp soy sauce</li>
                <h4>For the Soup Broth</h4>
                <li>300 ml Chicken Stock/Broth (homemade or store bought) (plus more to dilute the broth, as desired; use salted or unsalted; you will adjust the salt level to taste in the final stage of seasoning the ramen broth)</li>
                <li>300 ml unsweetened soy milk (plus more to make the broth creamier, as desired)</li>
                <li>kosher salt (Diamond Crystal; use half for table salt) (for seasoning the broth, to taste)</li>
                <h4>For the Ramen</h4>
                <li>1 head bok choy</li>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>	Gather all the ingredients. For substitute suggestions, please read the blog post. Prepare a big pot of water for cooking the bok choy and noodles. Slowly bring it to a boil on low heat while you prepare all the ingredients.	</li>
                <li>	A typical ramen bowl can hold 1200–1400 ml of liquid. We will prepare 1½ cups (360 ml) of soup broth per bowl, which should be more than enough for a ramen bowl size. If you're using bigger bowls, you may need to prepare extra soup to fill them up.	</li>
                <h4>	To Prepare the Soup Seasonings ("Tare")	</h4>
                <li>	Please note: Typically, ramen shops will prepare each ramen bowl to order, adding individual portions of tare soup seasonings and soup broth from their big stock pots. Since my ramen broth recipe is already pre-measured, I just combine the tare and broth together in one pot. For making ramen at home, I found this method creates a more flavorful outcome as you can meld all the seasoning ingredients and let them simmer together. If you prefer, you can portion this tare into the individual ramen bowls, then pour in the soup broth and mix it before adding your noodles. Make sure the soup broth is piping hot as it will cool down after mixing with the tare sitting at room temperature.	</li>
                <li>	In a medium bowl, combine the sesame paste and miso.	</li>
                <li>	Add the soy sauce, rice vinegar, and la-yu chili oil.	</li>
                <li>	Mix them all together (I use this whisk) and set aside. We'll use this seasoning mixture when we make the soup broth.	</li>
                <h4>	To Prepare the Aromatics and Bok Choy	</h4>
                <li>	Grate the ginger (I use a ceramic grater) and mince or press the garlic (I use a garlic press).	</li>
                <li>	Cut the bok choy in quarters lengthwise. Rinse well under cold running water and make sure there is no dirt between the leaves. Drain and set aside.	</li>
                <h4>	To Make the Pork Mixture	</h4>
                <li>	Heat a medium saucepan over medium heat. When the saucepan is hot, add the oil, then the pork.	</li>
                <li>	Cook the pork, stirring frequently, until it's no longer pink. When it's almost done cooking, add the sake and stir to combine. Tip: Sake helps remove the unwanted odor from the pork.	</li>
                <li>	Add the ginger and garlic and stir to combine.	</li>
                <li>	Add the doubanjiang and soy sauce and stir to mix.	</li>
                <li>	Lower the stove's heat to medium low and let the pork mixture simmer until the cooking liquid is almost evaporated, for about 2–3 minutes. Then, turn off the heat. Transfer half of the pork mixture to a bowl and leave the other half in the saucepan.	</li>
                <li>	Cover the bowl with plastic to avoid further evaporation and to keep it warm.	</li>
                <h4>	To Prepare the Soup Broth	</h4>
                <li>	With the stove's heat off, add the soup seasonings to the pork mixture in the saucepan and mix well.	</li>
                <li>	Turn on the stove's heat again to medium. With a spatula, stir the pork mixture constantly while you gradually add the chicken stock, combining them well. Tip: If you add the stock all at once, it'll be difficult to combine well.	</li>
                <li>	Then, gradually add the soy milk while stirring.	</li>
                <li>	Taste the soup now and adjust the seasoning with salt. Don't be shy about adding salt because the broth will taste less salty after you add the noodles. Also, if you feel it's too creamy or too thick to your taste, you can adjust the soup broth by adding a few tablespoons of chicken stock or water. Once the soup broth tastes good, turn off the heat, cover the saucepan with the lid, and set aside.	</li>
                <h4>	To Blanch the Bok Choy	</h4>
                <li>	Prepare a medium bowl of cold water and set aside. In the big pot of boiling water, add the bok choy, stem end first, and cook it for 2 minutes. When the bottom end is tender, turn off the heat.	</li>
                <li>	Without draining the water, remove the blanched boy choy from the pot and transfer it to the bowl of cold water to stop the cooking. Keep the hot water in the big pot to cook the noodles in the next step. Once the bok choy is cool enough to handle, squeeze the water out and set aside.	</li>
                <h4>	To Cook the Ramen Noodles	</h4>
                <li>	Now, it's time to reheat the soup broth until it's piping hot, but don't let it overboil because it may curdle. Before cooking the fresh noodles, loosen them up with your hands.	</li>
                <li>	Turn the stove's heat back on and bring the water in the big pot to a boil again. Once boiling, add the noodles and cook according to the package instructions. While cooking, stir and separate the noodles with chopsticks. Here, I cook the noodles inside a big noodle strainer (I got it in Japan) that I've set inside the pot.	</li>
                <li>	When the noodles are done cooking, drain them well in a strainer, shaking it a few times to drain the water thoroughly (otherwise it will dilute the soup broth). Transfer the noodles to the individual ramen bowls.	</li>
                <h4>	To Serve	</h4>
                <li>	Divide and pour the soup broth with seasonings over the noodles.	</li>
                <li>	Place the reserved pork mixture on top of the noodles and place the bok choy to one side to garnish.	</li>
                <h4>	To Store	</h4>
                <li>	You can keep the soup broth in the refrigerator for 3 days. Cook the noodles right before serving.	</li>
